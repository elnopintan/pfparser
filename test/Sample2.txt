Tactics
During Combat The agents� first goal is to get information,
and they use their poison to paralyze and incapacitate
their targets so they can extract whatever knowledge their
opponents have. If given what they desire, however, as well
as a safe opportunity to do so, the agents quickly turn on
their captives and attempt to slay them.
Morale When dropped below 7 hit points, these agents flee.
They are only hired muscle, and have no loyalty to their
faction beyond the coins in their purses.
